// What a Seedance submit will cost, read out of the submit request.
//
// The reservation ExtractUsage returns is a real charge against a real
// balance, so the number below has to be defensible in both directions: too
// low and a $0 balance queues expensive work (the pre-charge exists to stop
// exactly that), too high and a legitimate 5-second clip is refused for want
// of a balance nobody will ever be billed. It is corrected exactly at
// reconcile, so a brief over-estimate costs a user headroom while the task
// runs, and nothing after it.
//
// WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM. Ark publishes the formula (model pricing page,
// "视频生成模型"):
//
//	token 用量 = (输入视频时长 + 输出视频时长) x 宽 x 高 x 帧率 / 1024
//
// with the frame rate fixed at 24 fps for every Seedance model, and a table of
// the exact output pixel size per resolution x aspect ratio x model
// generation. Since frames = seconds x 24, the formula is frames x area /
// 1024, which is how it is written here: one number per table cell instead of
// two, and no rounding of a frame count Ark itself counts in frames.
//
// Ark calls its own formula an estimate and names usage.completion_tokens as
// the authority. That is exactly the division of labour here: this file
// reserves, ParseReconcileResponse settles on completion_tokens.
//
// THREE THINGS THE ESTIMATE CANNOT SEE, each bounded rather than guessed:
//
//  1. Parameters hidden in the prompt. resolution, ratio, duration, frames,
//     seed, camera_fixed and watermark may ALSO be passed as "--rs 1080p
//     --dur 10" suffixes on content[].text, on every model - a weakly
//     validated form Ark documents as equivalent to the structured field,
//     with NO documented precedence between the two. So the prompt is read
//     too, and where the readings disagree the more expensive one wins. Where
//     the prompt could not be read at all (longer than the host's per-value
//     cap, or in a content element past the declared paths) every parameter it
//     could have carried is treated as unknown - not as absent.
//  2. "The model decides". duration -1 means Ark picks a length inside the
//     model's range, and -1 is the documented default for Seedance 2.5. Ark
//     documents no default at all for the 2.0 and 1.0 families and does not
//     say what omitting the field does, so an unknown duration means the
//     model's maximum: 30s on 2.5, 15s on 2.0, 12s on 1.0 pro.
//  3. Input video. The formula adds the INPUT video's duration for an edit, an
//     extend or a reference-video task, and the input arrives as a URL or an
//     asset id whose length nothing here can know. Those tasks are therefore
//     under-estimated by the length of their own input, and only the reconcile
//     corrects it. Worth knowing before reading a pre-charge as a promise.
