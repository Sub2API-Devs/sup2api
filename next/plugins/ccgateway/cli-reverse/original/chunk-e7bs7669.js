var Yyn="ListConnectors",lKo="List the MCP connectors installed for the user's claude.ai org, optionally filtered by keyword.",dKo=`List the MCP connectors installed for the user's claude.ai org. Call this when the user asks what connectors they have. Pass keywords to filter to a topic; omit to list all.

Returns name, description, whether each connector is connected at org level (connected may be null when the status check was unavailable \u2014 treat that as unknown, not disconnected), and enabledInChat (whether its tools are loaded in this session). enabledInChat: false with connected: true means the connector's tools are not loaded in this session, so you cannot call them; the field does not say why. There may be no connector setting for this chat alone. If the request needs the connector, tell the user it is not available here and that they can check it, and its tool permissions, in their claude.ai connector settings. To recommend connectors the user does NOT have yet, use SearchMcpRegistry \u2192 SuggestConnectors instead; this tool does not itself connect anything.`;
