    - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.

Working directory persists between commands; shell state (variables, functions) does not.

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations via PowerShell: git, npm, docker, and PS cmdlets. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

${c(t)}
${a}
Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use \`Get-ChildItem\` (or \`ls\`) to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes
   - Capture the output of the command.

PowerShell Syntax Notes:
   - Variables use $ prefix: $myVar = "value"
   - Escape character is backtick (\`), not backslash
   - Use Verb-Noun cmdlet naming: Get-ChildItem, Set-Location, New-Item, Remove-Item
   - Common aliases: ls (Get-ChildItem), cd (Set-Location), cat (Get-Content), rm (Remove-Item)
   - Pipe operator | works similarly to bash but passes objects, not text
   - Use Select-Object, Where-Object, ForEach-Object for filtering and transformation
   - String interpolation: "Hello $name" or "Hello $($obj.Property)"
   - Registry access uses PSDrive prefixes: \`HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\...\`, \`HKCU:\\...\` \u2014 NOT raw \`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\...\`
   - Environment variables: read with \`$env:NAME\`, set with \`$env:NAME = "value"\` (NOT \`Set-Variable\` or bash \`export\`)
   - Call native exe with spaces in path via call operator: \`& "C:\\Program Files\\App\\app.exe" arg1 arg2\`

Unix commands that DO NOT exist in PowerShell \u2014 use the equivalent instead:
   - head / tail \u2192 \`Get-Content file -TotalCount N\` / \`-Tail N\`; piped: \`| Select-Object -First N\` / \`-Last N\`
   - which \u2192 \`(Get-Command name).Source\`
   - touch \u2192 \`if (-not (Test-Path path)) { New-Item -ItemType File path }\` (NEVER use \`New-Item -Force\` on a file \u2014 it truncates existing content)
   - wc -l \u2192 \`(Get-Content file | Measure-Object -Line).Lines\`
   - mkdir -p \u2192 \`New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force path\` (\`-p\` is not a PowerShell flag)
   - rm -rf \u2192 \`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force path\`
   - ln -s \u2192 \`New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path link -Target target\`
   - chmod / chown \u2192 not applicable on Windows; use \`icacls\` only if ACL changes are required
   - 2>/dev/null \u2192 \`2>$null\` (but stderr is captured for you \u2014 usually unnecessary)
   - VAR=x cmd \u2192 \`$env:VAR = 'x'; cmd\` (PowerShell has no inline env-var prefix)
   - Bash control flow (\`if [ -f x ]\`, \`for x in *\`, backtick \`\`cmd\`\` substitution) is a parser error \u2014 use \`if (Test-Path x)\`, \`foreach ($x in ...)\`, \`$(cmd)\`

Exit-code note: \`-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\` suppresses error OUTPUT but the cmdlet failure still causes this tool to report exit 1. To make a cmdlet failure truly non-fatal, promote it to terminating and swallow it: \`try { Cmdlet ... -ErrorAction Stop } catch {}\` (without \`-ErrorAction Stop\`, non-terminating errors skip the \`catch\` and still exit 1).

Interactive and blocking commands (this tool runs with -NonInteractive and stdin attached to the null device \u2014 console prompts read EOF or error immediately; GUI prompts can still block until timeout):
   - NEVER use \`Read-Host\`, \`Get-Credential\`, \`Out-GridView\`, \`$Host.UI.PromptForChoice\`, or \`pause\`
   - Destructive cmdlets (\`Remove-Item\`, \`Stop-Process\`, \`Clear-Content\`, etc.) may prompt for confirmation. Add \`-Confirm:$false\` when you intend the action to proceed. Use \`-Force\` for read-only/hidden items.
   - Never use \`git rebase -i\`, \`git add -i\`, or other commands that open an interactive editor

Passing multiline strings (commit messages, file content) to native executables:
   - Use a single-quoted here-string so PowerShell does not expand \`$\` or backticks inside. The closing \`'@\` MUST be at column 0 (no leading whitespace) on its own line \u2014 indenting it is a parse error:
<example>
git commit -m @'
Commit message here.
Second line with $literal dollar signs.
'@
</example>
   - Use \`@'...'@\` (single-quoted, literal) not \`@"..."@\` (double-quoted, interpolated) unless you need variable expansion
   - For arguments containing \`-\`, \`@\`, or other characters PowerShell parses as operators, use the stop-parsing token: \`git log --% --format=%H\`

Usage notes:
  - The command argument is required.
  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to ${Myn()}ms / ${Myn()/60000} minutes for a foreground command). If not specified, commands will timeout after ${nqr()}ms (${nqr()/60000} minutes).
  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does.
  - If the output exceeds ${OB()} characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.
${n?n+`
`:""}  - Avoid using PowerShell to run commands that have dedicated tools, unless explicitly instructed:
    - File search: Use ${no} (NOT Get-ChildItem -Recurse)
    - Content search: Use ${gr} (NOT Select-String)
    - Read files: Use ${Ge} (NOT Get-Content)
    - Edit files: Use ${lt}
    - Write files: Use ${Jt} (NOT Set-Content/Out-File)
    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT Write-Output/Write-Host)
  - When issuing multiple commands:
    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple ${yt} tool calls in a single message.
    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, chain them in a single ${yt} call (see edition-specific chaining syntax above).
    - Use \`;\` only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.
    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings and here-strings)
  - Do NOT prefix commands with \`cd\` or \`Set-Location\` -- the working directory is already set to the correct project directory automatically.${i?`
