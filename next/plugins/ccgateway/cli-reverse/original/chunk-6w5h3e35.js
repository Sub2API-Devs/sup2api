Remote Control - Control local sessions from claude.ai/code or the Claude mobile app

USAGE
  claude remote-control [options]
OPTIONS
  --name <name>                    Name for the session (shown in claude.ai/code)
  --remote-control-session-name-prefix <prefix>
                                   Prefix for auto-generated session names
                                   (default: hostname; env:
                                   CLAUDE_REMOTE_CONTROL_SESSION_NAME_PREFIX)
  -c, --continue                   Reattach to the session \`claude remote-control\`
                                   last recorded for this directory (or one of its
                                   git worktrees) instead of creating a new one.
                                   Exits with an error if nothing was recorded
                                   here within roughly the last 4 hours
  --session-id <id>                Reattach to a specific session by ID (cannot be
                                   used with spawn flags or --continue)
  --permission-mode <mode>         Permission mode for spawned sessions
                                   (${s})
  --[no-]chrome                    Claude in Chrome for spawned sessions
                                   (default: off; a session started from a
                                   project follows this machine's /chrome
                                   setting)
  -d, --debug[=<filter>]           Enable debug mode for this process, with
                                   optional category filtering (e.g.
                                   --debug=api,hooks)
  --debug-file <path>              Write debug logs to file
  -v, --verbose                    Enable verbose output
  -h, --help                       Show this help
  --spawn <mode>                   Spawn mode: same-dir, worktree, session
                                   (default: same-dir)
  --capacity <N>                   Max concurrent sessions in worktree or
                                   same-dir mode (default: ${oxr})
  --[no-]create-session-in-dir     Pre-create a session in the current
                                   directory; in worktree mode this session
                                   stays in cwd while on-demand sessions get
                                   isolated worktrees (default: on)
${e?`  --allow-unattended-tool-calls    Let your cloud sessions use this folder for
                                   this run. Their auto-mode commands run
                                   without asking, inside the sandbox only
                                   (choose a mode in /sandbox first); otherwise
                                   they ask. Start it yourself in a terminal.

DESCRIPTION
  Remote Control allows you to control sessions on your local device from
  claude.ai/code (https://claude.ai/code) or the Claude mobile app. Run
  this command in the directory you want to work in, then connect from
  your phone or a browser.${l4t()?` Your projects on claude.ai can also ask Claude to
  work in this directory.`:""}

  Claude and its commands run on this computer; claude.ai and the app only
  show the session. Keep this computer awake and this command running, or
  the session stops. (A Cloud session is the opposite: Claude runs in the
  cloud and this computer can be off.)
${e?`
  Your cloud sessions can also run file, shell and MCP tools in this
  folder (see --allow-unattended-tool-calls), under this computer's
  permission rules. Those calls fail while this computer is asleep or this
  command is stopped.
`:""}
  Remote Control runs as a persistent server that accepts multiple concurrent
  sessions in the current directory. One session is pre-created on start so
  you have somewhere to type immediately. Use --spawn=worktree to isolate
  each on-demand session in its own git worktree, or --spawn=session for
  the classic single-session mode (exits when that session ends). Press 'w'
  during runtime to toggle between same-dir and worktree.

NOTES
  - You must be logged in with a Claude account that has a subscription
  - In a folder you haven't trusted yet you'll be asked whether to trust it
    (with no terminal to ask on, run \`claude\` there once first)
  - Worktree mode requires a git repository or WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks
