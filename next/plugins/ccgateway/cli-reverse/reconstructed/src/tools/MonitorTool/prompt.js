- **One per occurrence, until a known end** ("emit each CI step result, stop when the run completes") \u2192 Monitor with a command that emits lines and then exits.`
}

Your script's stdout is the event stream. Each line becomes a notification. Exit ends the watch.

  # Each matching log line is an event
  tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep --line-buffered "ERROR"

  # Each file change is an event
  inotifywait -m --format '%e %f' /watched/dir

  # Poll GitHub for new PR comments and emit one line per new comment
  last=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
  while true; do
    now=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
    gh api "repos/owner/repo/issues/123/comments?since=$last" --jq '.[] | "\\(.user.login): \\(.body)"'
    last=$now; sleep 30
  done

  # Node script that emits events as they arrive (e.g. WebSocket listener)
  node watch-for-events.js

  # Per-occurrence with a natural end: emit each CI check as it lands, exit when the run completes
  prev=""
  while true; do
    s=$(gh pr checks 123 --json name,bucket)
    cur=$(jq -r '.[] | select(.bucket!="pending") | "\\(.name): \\(.bucket)"' <<<"$s" | sort)
    comm -13 <(echo "$prev") <(echo "$cur")
    prev=$cur
    jq -e 'all(.bucket!="pending")' <<<"$s" >/dev/null && break
    sleep 30
  done

**Don't use an unbounded command for a single notification.** \`tail -f\`, \`inotifywait -m\`, and \`while true\` never exit on their own, so the monitor stays armed until timeout even after the event has fired. For "tell me when X is ready," ${singleNotificationAlternative}. Note that \`tail -f log | grep -m 1 ...\` does *not* fix this: if the log goes quiet after the match, \`tail\` never receives SIGPIPE and the pipeline hangs anyway.

**Script quality:**
- Every pipe stage must flush per line or matches sit in its buffer unseen: \`grep\` needs \`--line-buffered\`, \`awk\` needs \`fflush()\`. \`head\` cannot flush at all \u2014 \`| head -N\` delivers nothing until N matches accumulate, then ends the stream.
- In poll loops, handle transient failures (\`curl ... || true\`) \u2014 one failed request shouldn't kill the monitor.
- Poll intervals: 30s+ for remote APIs (rate limits), 0.5-1s for local checks.
- Write a specific \`description\` \u2014 it appears in every notification ("errors in deploy.log" not "watching logs").
- Only stdout is the event stream. Stderr goes to the output file (readable via Read) but does not trigger notifications \u2014 for a command you run directly (e.g. \`python train.py 2>&1 | grep --line-buffered ...\`), merge stderr with \`2>&1\` so its failures reach your filter. (No effect on \`tail -f\` of an existing log \u2014 that file only contains what its writer redirected.)

**Coverage \u2014 silence is not success.** When watching a job or process for an outcome, your filter must match every terminal state, not just the happy path. A monitor that greps only for the success marker stays silent through a crashloop, a hung process, or an unexpected exit \u2014 and silence looks identical to "still running." Before arming, ask: *if this process crashed right now, would my filter emit anything?* If not, widen it.

  # Wrong \u2014 silent on crash, hang, or any non-success exit
  tail -f run.log | grep --line-buffered "elapsed_steps="

  # Right \u2014 one alternation covering progress + the failure signatures you'd act on
  tail -f run.log | grep -E --line-buffered "elapsed_steps=|Traceback|Error|FAILED|assert|Killed|OOM"

For poll loops checking job state, emit on every terminal status (\`succeeded|failed|cancelled|timeout\`), not just success. If you cannot confidently enumerate the failure signatures, broaden the grep alternation rather than narrow it \u2014 some extra noise is better than missing a crashloop.

**Output volume**: Every stdout line is a conversation message, so the filter should be selective \u2014 but selective means "the lines you'd act on," not "only good news." Never pipe raw logs; filter to exactly the success and failure signals you care about. Monitors that produce too many events are automatically stopped; restart with a tighter filter if this happens.

Stdout lines within 200ms are batched into a single notification, so multiline output from a single event groups naturally.

The script runs in the same shell environment as Bash. Exit ends the watch (exit code is reported). ${monitorExpiryParagraph()} Use TaskStop to cancel early.`;

Each text frame becomes one notification (multiline frames stay as one event). Binary frames are reported as \`[binary frame, N bytes]\` rather than passed through. Socket close ends the watch with the close code surfaced; errors are surfaced before close. Same rate limiting as bash \u2014 a firehose will be suppressed and eventually stopped, so subscribe to a filtered feed where one exists.

Prefer this over \`command: 'websocat wss://\u2026'\` \u2014 it avoids the extra process and line-buffering pitfalls. Use bash when you need to transform or filter frames with shell tools before they become events.`;
