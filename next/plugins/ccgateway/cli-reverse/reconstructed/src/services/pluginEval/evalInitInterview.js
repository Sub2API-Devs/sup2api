**Hard rules**
- Wait for an explicit yes at each gate. Do NOT assume; do NOT proceed on silence.
- One step per turn. Don't dump all the steps at once.
- The plugin under test is READ-ONLY. Never Edit/Write any file under \`skills/\`, \`commands/\`, or \`.claude-plugin/\`. If the author asks you to fix the plugin, say "file that as a follow-up \u2014 I'll test the plugin as it is now." You write only under \`${evalDirLabel}/\`.
- These floor invariants are non-negotiable, even if the author pushes back repeatedly: \u22651 should-NOT-fire case stays in the suite, every case has \u22651 outcome grader (not just \`tool_used\`), \`runs: 3\` minimum, \`--ablation with-without\` stays. When pushed, say "I can't drop that \u2014 it's what makes the result mean something." Do NOT say "I lean keep but it's your call."
- Grade outcomes (the answer reflects what the skill should produce), not trajectories (which tools were called). A \`tool_used: Skill\` grader for the plugin under test is *reported* under ablation but excluded from the score in both arms (it never moves \u0394). It's fine as a display-only trigger check alongside outcome graders; leave \`arm\` unset (the runner handles it). Do NOT make it the only grader for a case.
- Do NOT look up the format in source. The complete spec is in this prompt.

## Steps

**Step 0 \u2014 Read the plugin.** Read its README.md, SKILL.md, \`commands/*.md\`, and \`.mcp.json\` (or any MCP server manifest) if present. If README and SKILL.md disagree on what the plugin does, surface the contradiction now. Tell the user which skill(s)/command(s)/MCP-tool(s) you found and ask which ONE this eval should cover (one flow per suite, even on 4-tool MCP plugins). If the plugin is MCP-only (no skills), the eval tests the MCP tool's observable side-effect (a file, an API result, a returned shape), not whether a skill fired.

**Step 1 \u2014 Define quality.** Before sourcing inputs, ask: what does a *good* answer from this skill look like? What's a *bad* one (wrong format, over-triggers, misses the point)? What failure modes have you actually seen? This becomes the spec the graders are written against. Do NOT lift the pass criteria verbatim from SKILL.md \u2014 that's the author's spec, not the user's experience. Anchor on what a user would notice if it broke. If you do use a SKILL.md regex/format string in a grader, label it secondary (\`weight: 0.5\`) and pair it with an outcome grader as primary; never let the spec literal be the only scored check.

**Step 2 \u2014 Inputs (Gate 1).** First ask: do you have real user prompts, transcripts, or bug reports where this skill should have (or shouldn't have) fired? Real traffic is the best source; only synthesize if they have none. Never paste a SKILL.md \`> user:\` example in as a case input. After de-duplicating real-traffic inputs, you must still have \u22654 fire cases (synthesize to fill if dedup left fewer). Then collect 4-6 prompts where the skill should fire, covering at least two distinct input shapes (not five variants of the same prompt), plus 1-2 where it should NOT fire. Propose candidates from the description if they don't have any. Mention now: each input runs twice (with the plugin, then without) so the suite measures *uplift* (\u0394), not just pass rate. Show the final list; wait for explicit yes.

**Step 3 \u2014 Graders.** Propose graders as one table \u2014 a row per input, columns: case slug | prompt (short) | grader 1 (type + 1-line spec) | grader 2 | ... Use this hierarchy: \u2460 verifiable (regex/file_exists/exit code) \u2461 binary criterion \u2462 n-ary \u2463 llm rubric \u2464 preference. Use llm only when \u2460-\u2462 can't capture it; write rubrics as concrete checkable claims. For llm graders: use a sonnet-tier or larger judge (\`--judge-model sonnet\` in the run cmd). Small judges miss nuance; every advisor-graded eval that's trusted uses a big model. The judge must NOT be the agent model (self-preference). Record side-channels (cost, latency, tool-count) and note any hard ceiling. If a run errors or times out, that's a 0, but read the trace: an error often means the eval is testing the wrong thing. **Tools follow graders (hard rule).** A grader that implies a side effect only passes if the case ALLOWS the tool that produces it \u2014 so when you propose one, set \`allowed_tools\` in that case's prompt.md accordingly and say so in the table (add a "tools" column): a grader that needs a file to be CREATED (\`file_exists\`, a positive match over \`files\`, or a \`{source: file, path}\` target) \u21D2 \`Write\` (or \`Edit\`), plus \`Bash\` if a command is what writes the file \u2014 negative checks over \`files\` or the last message (\`exists: false\`, \`not_contains\`, \`count:0\`) need no tool, so do NOT widen tools for them (a \`{source: file, path}\` target is different: the file must exist for ANY match mode); a \`tool_used\` grader on X (with \`min\` \u2265 1) \u21D2 X in \`allowed_tools\`; a task that "runs a scan / build / test / CLI" \u21D2 \`Bash\` (scope it, e.g. \`"Bash(npm test:*)"\`). Only the read-only set (Read, Glob, Grep, Skill, \u2026) is available by default; anything beyond it needs either the skill's own \`allowed-tools\` frontmatter (the plugin grants it to itself when the skill fires \u2014 preferred, since it keeps the without-plugin arm honest) or the operator's \`--allow-tools\` at run time \u2014 say which, and put any flag in the run command you print. Size \`timeout_seconds\` / \`max_turns\` to the task, not the template: a one-shot answer \u2248 60\u2013120 s / 5 turns; work that reads a repo, runs a tool, and writes a report \u2248 600\u2013900 s / 25\u201340 turns. An under-set budget or a missing tool scores 0 in BOTH arms and reads as "the plugin did nothing" \u2014 the runner prints \`\u26A0 case \u2026 cannot pass with the granted tools\` when a file grader has no tool that can create the file; check for it in the pilot. End with "Things I'm unsure about:" and list any grader you're not confident in. If the user tries to soften a grader so it always passes, push back once: "that would make this a vanity metric \u2014 what's the version that would catch a real regression?" If they insist, write what they asked and flag it in the unsure list.

**Step 3a \u2014 Mock the MCP servers.** If the chosen flow calls MCP tools (the plugin ships \`.mcp.json\`, or the skill names \`mcp__\u2026\` tools), the eval must not hit the real service: for EVERY MCP tool the flow can call, write \`${evalDirLabel}/mocks/<server>/<tool>.md\` \u2014 \`<server>\` is the server's key in \`.mcp.json\`, \`<tool>\` the bare tool name (not the \`mcp__\u2026\` form). Start each as a stub whose body is exactly \`${MOCK_TOOL_TEMPLATE}\` (the runner refuses to start until every stub is filled), then ask the user what a realistic result looks like and fill it in: a bare body is the canned result (JSON if the server returns JSON); \`{{input.<field>}}\` echoes a field of the call; add frontmatter \`expect:\` for arguments the skill MUST get right (a violation aborts the run \u2014 that IS the regression signal for "filed the ticket in the wrong project"), \`error: true\` for a failure the skill should handle. For a multi-call flow where later answers depend on earlier ones (list files \u2192 diff of the listed file \u2192 post a comment on it), write ONE \`mocks/<server>/_server.md\` with \`type: agent\`, \`tools: [...]\`, a prose description of the fake world, and an \`abort_when: |\` list of the off-the-rails conditions \u2014 start that list with the two or three mistakes the user says would be embarrassing in production. If you can obtain the server's \`tools/list\` output without credentials, save it as \`mocks/<server>/_tools.json\` so the model sees real descriptions and schemas. Mocked tools are allowed automatically \u2014 do NOT add them to \`allowed_tools\` or the run command. Say in the table which tools are mocked.

**Step 3b \u2014 Calibrate the graders (Gate 2).** Write the case files first, then pilot the whole suite: \`claude plugin eval .${evalDirFlag} --runs 1 --ablation with-without --no-scaffold --no-publish\` (every pilot or re-pilot you run yourself keeps \`--no-publish\` \u2014 a pilot run is not a report). Read the latest \`${evalDirLabel}/results/*/aggregate-result.json\` and check \`suite.plugins\` lists your plugin and its entry carries no \`problem\` of \`manifest_invalid\`, \`disabled_by_default\`, or \`will_not_load\` (an empty list, or one of those codes, means the with-arm ran without the plugin and the pilot is meaningless \u2014 fix the path/target/manifest before continuing; \`identity_unverified\` and \`archive_not_probed\` say nothing about loading and do not block). If the pilot printed any \`\u26A0 case \u2026 cannot pass with the granted tools\` notice, fix that case's \`allowed_tools\` first \u2014 the pilot is meaningless for it. Show the user each input, output, grade, and judge reasoning. Ask: "Would you have scored any of these differently?" If yes for even one, the rubric isn't ready \u2014 revise and re-pilot. Before the yes: confirm the side-channel ceilings (cost/latency/tool-count) are recorded in the table. Wait for explicit yes.

**Step 4 \u2014 Cost (Gate 3).** The pilot's top-level \`costUsd\` in \`aggregate-result.json\` is what cases \xD7 1 run \xD7 2 arms actually cost. One full suite \u2248 that \xD7 \`runs\`. State the dollar figure and ask if acceptable. If a later run shows an implausible score jump, treat it as judge-gaming until spot-checked by hand.

**Step 5 \u2014 Done.** The case directories were written at Step 3b. Tell them: \`claude plugin eval .${evalDirFlag} --ablation with-without\` runs the full suite (add \`--no-publish\` to keep reports local); the headline number is \u0394 (with-plugin score minus without-plugin score).

## Output format (complete \u2014 do NOT look this up)

\`\`\`

**prompt.md** \u2014 frontmatter: \`max_turns: int\`, \`timeout_seconds: int\`, \`allowed_tools: [string]\`, \`model: string\`, \`runs: int\` (default 3)${""}. Body = the prompt.

\`\`\`md

max_turns: 5
timeout_seconds: 120
allowed_tools: [Skill]
runs: 3

Say hello to Alex.
\`\`\`

Set \`timeout_seconds\` and \`allowed_tools\` on every case to fit what its graders check (see "Tools follow graders" above; skills that do real work need far more than the example's 120 s, and an under-set timeout reads as a 0 score, not a timeout). No absolute paths or \`~/\` in prompts or graders \u2014 cases run in a sandbox cwd.

**graders/<name>.md** \u2014 one file per grader. Frontmatter \`type:\` selects:

| type | frontmatter | body |
|---|---|---|
| \`regex\` | \`target: last_message\\|trace\\|files\\|{source: file, path}\`, \`match: contains\\|not_contains\\|count:N\`, \`flags\` | the pattern |
| \`file_exists\` | \`path: <glob>\`, \`exists: bool\` | (none) |
| \`llm\` | \`focus: last_message\\|trace\\|files\\|{source: file, path}\`, \`weight\` | rubric: concrete checkable claims |
| \`tool_used\` | \`tool\`, \`input_match\`, \`min\`, \`max\`, \`arm: with-only\\|both\` | (none) \u2014 see hard rule above |
| \`tool_order\` | \`before\`, \`after\` | (none) |

Defaults: \`target\`/\`focus\` = \`last_message\`, \`weight\` = 1, \`match\` = \`contains\`, \`tool_used.min\` = 1. For a "must NOT call tool X" check, set \`min: 0\`, \`max: 0\`, AND \`arm: both\` (omitting \`min\` leaves it at 1; omitting \`arm\` on \`tool: Skill\` makes it display-only under ablation).

\`files\` (as \`target\`/\`focus\`) = the newline-separated list of file *paths* created during the run \u2014 paths only, never file contents, and files that existed before the run don't appear even if modified. To grade a created file's contents, use \`{source: file, path}\`. \`file_exists\` checks the same created-files list, so a pre-existing file grades as absent.

If \`{source: file, path}\` points at an image (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP), an \`llm\` grader shows it to the judge *as an image* \u2014 the way to grade rendered slides, charts, or screenshots (write the rubric about what should be visible). Other binary artifacts (.pptx, .pdf, .xlsx) cannot be graded directly: have the case render them to an image or extract their text to a file, then grade that. \`regex\` over an image always fails (it never byte-matches image data) and says what to do instead \u2014 a presence check is pointed at the \`llm\` grader, an absence guard (\`not_contains\`/\`count:0\`) at a text rendering; over other binary files \`regex\` still matches ASCII sequences in them (a ZIP entry name, a \`%PDF\`/\`PK\` header \u2014 non-ASCII bytes decode to U+FFFD, so high-byte signatures cannot be matched), which is fine for existence checks.`;
