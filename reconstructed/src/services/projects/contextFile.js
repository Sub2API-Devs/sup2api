    "Send this session\u2019s work to a Claude Project: show the user the drafted brief on this tool\u2019s own confirmation pane and, if they approve there, create the project (or use the one named by project_id), optionally add the folder\u2019s GitHub origin as its repository, save the brief to project memory, post it as the project\u2019s setup card, and tell the project which Remote Control session the work came from.",
  CONTINUE_IN_PROJECTS_TOOL_PROMPT = `A Claude Project is a cloud workspace on claude.ai/code: it has a coordinator and threads that do the work. This tool is how a session\u2019s work gets there. It is the last step of /send-to-project and works only in the turn where the user ran that command themselves: anywhere else it refuses, so when the user wants this and has not run the command, tell them to run /send-to-project. In that turn, read the folder\u2019s context first with \`${"SendToProjectContext"}\`, then call this tool as soon as you have drafted the brief. Its confirmation pane is where the user reads the brief and decides, so do not paste it into the conversation or ask for a go-ahead before calling. That would make them review it twice.

What it does. The tool first shows the user its own confirmation pane, with the brief you pass and every step spelled out, and it does nothing unless they choose Yes. Then:
- Without \`project_id\` it creates a personal project named \`project_name\`, with the brief\u2019s icon, color and instructions. If \`attach_git_remote\` is true it also adds this folder\u2019s GitHub origin as the project\u2019s repository, which it reads from git itself. There is deliberately no way to pass a URL, and the brief carries no repositories.
- With \`project_id\` it uses that existing project; nothing is created, no repository is added, and the project keeps its name, appearance and instructions.
- Either way it saves the brief, rendered as markdown, to project memory as ${"project-imported-context.md"} (with a line in MEMORY.md), posts it as the project\u2019s setup card, and tells the project this session\u2019s Remote Control id, so its coordinator can read the session when it needs detail. It starts no thread: the setup card lists the brief\u2019s threads and the user starts each one there. It needs Remote Control on for this session and refuses without it.
Creating or looking up the project is the only step that can fail the whole call; a later step that fails comes back as a note next to the project link, so relay the notes to the user.

The inputs. \`proposal\` is the brief in the shape /send-to-project describes (the same object the coordinator\u2019s propose_project_setup takes), with nothing in it you would not want stored or posted: no secrets, tokens or credentials, and identifiers copied exactly from where you read them. The pane shows the user this object as you pass it, so pass the finished brief, never a draft with placeholders. If the user declines the pane, nothing was created or sent: when the rejection carries what they want changed, revise and call again with the whole revised brief; on a bare decline, stop (once they have said what they want, they run /send-to-project again). After a call that went through, do not call again in this run. That would create a second project or post the setup card twice. \`project_id\` is for a run that sends to an existing project: pass the id the command gave you unchanged, keep \`project_name\` as a plain label, leave \`proposal.name\`, \`proposal.icon\`, \`proposal.color\` and \`proposal.instructions\` out, and set \`attach_git_remote\` to false.`,
  MESSAGE_DESCRIPTION =
    "Send one message to a Claude Project as the user: show them the message on this tool\u2019s own confirmation pane and, if they approve there, create the project (or use the one named by project_id), optionally add the folder\u2019s GitHub origin as its repository, post the message in the project, and tell the project which Remote Control session it came from.",
  MESSAGE_TOOL_PROMPT =
    "A Claude Project is a cloud workspace on claude.ai/code: it has a coordinator and threads that do the work. This tool posts one message there as the user. It is the last step of /send-to-project and works only in the turn where the user ran that command themselves: anywhere else it refuses, so when the user wants this and has not run the command, tell them to run /send-to-project. Call it with the inputs the command gives. Its confirmation pane is where the user reads the message and decides, so do not paste the message into the conversation or ask for a go-ahead before calling.\n\nWhat it does. The tool first shows the user its own confirmation pane, with the message, and it does nothing unless they choose Send. Then:\n- Without `project_id` it creates a personal project under the name the command chose. If `attach_git_remote` is true it also adds this folder\u2019s GitHub origin as the project\u2019s repository, which it reads from git itself.\n- With `project_id` it uses that existing project; nothing is created and no repository is added.\n- Either way it posts the message in the project as the user, with this session\u2019s Remote Control id under it, so the project can read the session when it needs detail. The project\u2019s Claude answers it there. It saves nothing to project memory and posts no setup card. It needs Remote Control on for this session and refuses without it.\n\nThe inputs. `proposal` takes only `summary`, which is the message. When the user typed the message with the command, the tool sends their words as typed and ignores `summary`, until they ask for a change. Otherwise write it in the user\u2019s voice, in at most three plain sentences, with no secrets, tokens or credentials. If the user declines the pane, nothing was created or sent: when the rejection carries what they want changed, revise and call again; on a bare decline, stop. After a call that went through, do not call again in this run.";
